A toolkit for inspecting Planetside 2 files. It should work on other Forgelight files, but for now I am not interested in supporting them.

This project was at one point worked on in #REside on irc.planetside-universe.com
Planetside Universe has since shut down. If you can find an an archive, let me know. I'd like to see what was discussed there.

For now, contact me on discord NatCracken#1770.


Building
=====
Project was created with Visual Studio 2012. I am working on this fork in VS 2019

You need OpenTK that targets .NET Framework 4.x: https://opentk.net/
I am using OpenTK 3.3.2 and OpenTK.GLControl 3.1.0. They can be easilly installed through VS's NuGet manager.
